# DeepSTORM3D_new
a new version of DeepSTORM3D with some user-friendly adjustments and large-FOV implementation

On the basis of DeepSTORM3D (Nehme, E., et al. (2020). "DeepSTORM3D: dense 3D localization microscopy and PSF design by deep learning." Nat Methods 17(7): 734-740.), some adjustments are added 
to make it more user-friendly (from my perspective). Furthermore, large FOV implementation is introduced.
