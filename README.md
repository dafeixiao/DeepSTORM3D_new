# DeepSTORM3D_new
DeepSTORM3D with some adjustments and large-FOV implementation

On the basis of DeepSTORM3D (Nehme, E., et al. (2020). "DeepSTORM3D: dense 3D localization microscopy and PSF design by deep learning." Nat Methods 17(7): 734-740.), some adjustments are added 
to make it more user-friendly (from my perspective). Furthermore, large FOV implementation is introduced.

For localization, one may only focus on parameter_sets.py, train_lcnn.py, and test_lcnn.py.
